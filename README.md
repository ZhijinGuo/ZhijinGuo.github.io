# ZhijinGuo.github.io

Personal site for Zhijin Guo powered by the [al-folio](https://github.com/alshedivat/al-folio) Jekyll theme. The layout and data scaffolding come straight from the upstream template so new content can be filled in gradually.

## Getting started

```bash
bundle install
bundle exec jekyll serve
```

Then browse http://localhost:4000 to preview changes before pushing to GitHub Pages.

## Next steps

- Update `_config.yml` with analytics, social, and navigation preferences.
- Replace placeholder copy in `_pages/about.md` and populate collections (e.g., `_projects`, `_news`, `_publications`).
- Swap in your own assets under `assets/img` and `assets/pdf` as needed.
