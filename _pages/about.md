I am a Postdoctoral Researcher at the University of Oxford, specializing in NLP, GNNs and various applications of LLMs. My work focuses on developing and fine-tuning large language models, applying advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP)/GNN techniques, and leveraging machine learning to analyze complex data. I have experience in Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), knowledge graph construction, text analysis, and AI-driven prediction models, with applications spanning social media analysis, recommender systems, and financial analytics.
