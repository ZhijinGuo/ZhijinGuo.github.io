I build responsible AI systems that link academic innovation with business outcomes. My recent work spans retrieval-augmented generation for research desks, graph intelligence for anti-financial-crime, and human-in-the-loop governance that keeps enterprise AI auditable.

Before joining J.P. Morgan AI Research, I collaborated with teams at the University of Oxford and industry partners across Europe. I continue to co-author peer-reviewed research and speak about trustworthy, high-impact AI.

### Current Roles
- Senior AI Research Scientist, J.P. Morgan AI Research
- Visiting Researcher, University of Oxford Engineering Science
- Quantitative Research Consultant, Predictive Labs (LLM workflows for finance)

### What I Solve
- Translate cutting-edge NLP and graph ML into resilient, explainable products for trading, compliance, and macro research.
- Build retrieval-augmented systems that connect enterprise knowledge graphs with large language models in production.
- Design governance frameworks and evaluation harnesses that keep AI trustworthy across global deployments.

### Collaboration Style
I like partnering with interdisciplinary teams where rigor meets velocity—bringing together quant researchers, product, engineering, and control functions. If you're scoping a research collaboration, piloting a GenAI product, or planning an event, reach out and let's explore it.
