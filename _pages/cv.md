## RESEARCH EXPEREINCE


Knowledge Graph Embedding 2022

- Aim of the project: debiasing knowledge graph embedding
- Knowledge Graphs (KGs) store human knowledge about the world in structured format. Once
    constructed, knowledge graphs are often considered as “gold standard” data sources that
    safeguard the correctness of other systems
- Measuring the sensitive bias such as gender bias in a Movie Recommender system
- Embeddings are trained to be neutral to sensitive attributes
- Data used are taken from https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/1m/


Knowledge Graph Embedding 2022

- Aim of the project: predicting rating that users assign movies
- Focusing on the use of knowledge graph embedding techniques to generate and represent
    knowledge/ relations by a latent vector representation
- Root mean square error is applied to evaluate the predicted rating
- Data used are taken from https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/1m/


Graph Embedding 2021

- Aim of the project: Calculating the embedding of London tube
- Calculating embedding of each station by reducing the dimensionality of the adjacency matrix
- Evaluating the embedding by comparing it with the real physical distance matrix
- Data used are taken from https://tfl.gov.uk/maps/track/tube


Word Embedding 2021

- Aim of the project: Calculating the word embedding of a large corpus
- Calculating the word embedding by implementing GloVe: Global Vectors for Word Representations
- Embeddings are calculated by reducing the dimensionality of the co-occurrence matrix of each
    word
- Applying PCA to project the embeddings into a two-dimensional space

## WORK EXPEREINCE
