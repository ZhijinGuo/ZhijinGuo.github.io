This paper investigates the principles of compositionality in data embedding approaches, exploring how complex representations can be constructed from simpler components.

**Abstract**: We analyze compositionality in various data embedding methods, examining how embeddings capture both semantic and structural information across different data types including text, graphs, and knowledge bases.

**Key Contributions**:
- Theoretical analysis of compositionality in embedding methods
- Empirical evaluation across multiple embedding types
- Framework for understanding compositional properties
- Applications to knowledge graph and text embeddings

**Results**: The analysis revealed fundamental principles governing how embeddings compose to form more complex representations, with implications for both interpretability and performance.
