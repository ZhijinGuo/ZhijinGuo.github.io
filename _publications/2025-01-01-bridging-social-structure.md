This work addresses the challenge of Reddit communities exhibiting escalating polarization by developing a hybrid RAG pipeline that combines user-language features, fine-tuned language models, and continuous-time graph neural networks.

**Abstract**: Reddit communities were exhibiting escalating polarization, making proactive moderation impossible and increasing user churn. This work builds a hybrid RAG pipeline that retrieves user-language features via embeddings, fine-tunes LLAMA and BERT models for sentiment and persuasion-signal prediction, and trains a continuous-time GNN to model interaction dynamics.

**Key Contributions**:
- Hybrid RAG pipeline for social media analysis
- Fine-tuning of LLAMA and BERT models using Hugging Face Transformers
- Continuous-time GNN for modeling interaction dynamics
- 70% accuracy in forecasting community fragmentation
- Analysis of linguistic and interaction factors driving polarization

**Results**: Successfully forecast community fragmentation weeks ahead with 70% accuracy, enabling moderators to implement targeted interventions.
