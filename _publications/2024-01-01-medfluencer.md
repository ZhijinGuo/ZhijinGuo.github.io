This paper presents a comprehensive network analysis of medical influencers on social media, examining how their identities and discourse patterns affect health information dissemination and public trust during health crises.

**Abstract**: Health misinformation spread unchecked during COVID-19, complicating public-trust efforts by authorities. This work compiles tweets from the top 100 medical influencers by "Influencer Score" and builds a few-shot, multi-label classifier for analyzing their discourse patterns.

**Key Contributions**:
- Network representation of medical influencer identities
- Multi-label classification with 70% F1 score
- Thematic analysis of health discourse patterns
- Dynamic knowledge graph construction for discourse networks
